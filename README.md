# Effective Climate Action
`http://effectiveclimateaction.github.io`

Effective Climate Action is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to stop or reverse climate change?

It's modeled on the same ideas that drive [Effective Altruism](http://effectivealtruism.org), but adapted to the problem of Climate Change.
