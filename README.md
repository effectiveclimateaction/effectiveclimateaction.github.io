# Effective Climate Action
`http://effectiveclimateaction.github.io`


## Vision
Effective Climate Action will try to answer one question: what actions are most effective to stop or reverse climate change?

It's modeled on the same ideas that drive [Effective Altruism](http://effectivealtruism.org), but adapted to the problem of Climate Change. 

For people considering what they can do to help with Climate Change, this guide will hopefully help their decision making process by bringing data to show the impact of possible actions they can take.

## Status
